    <h1>Beef Bourguignon</h1>
    <img src="../images/beef-bourguignon.jpg" alt="Beef Bourguignon" width="300" height="300">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the speedy, easy version of boeuf Bourguignon, 
        the classic French slow-cooked beef dish. Delicious 
        over cooked egg noodles or mashed potatoes. Leftovers 
        taste great as well - just reheat on the stove.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (6 servings)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed and 
            cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices thick-cut hickory smoked bacon, cut 
            into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced baby portobello 
            mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 pound carrots, cut diagonally into 1/2-inch 
            slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Â½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss together beef pieces, salt, and pepper in a 
            medium bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat 
            until fat is rendered and bacon is beginning to 
            brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Add seasoned beef to bacon 
            and cook, stirring often, until well browned, 7 to 
            8 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring often, 
            until beginning to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 
            garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 
            minute.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms and tomato paste to mixture and cook, 
            stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Stir in broth, 
            wine, and carrots and bring mixture to a boil. 
            Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 40 to 45 
            minutes or until beef is fork-tender.</li>
        <li>Uncover and remove 1/2 cup broth to a 1-cup glass 
            measuring cup. Whisk in flour until completely 
            combined and smooth. Stir flour mixture back into 
            beef mixture and stir constantly until thickened 
            slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped 
            parsley and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
